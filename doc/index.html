	<h1><i>swift:</i> the multiparty transport protocol</h1>
	
	<div id='motto'>Turn the Net into a single data Cloud!</div>
	
	<div>	<h2>Ideas</h2>
		<p>As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-centric_networking">
		wise people say</a>, the Internet was initially built for
		remotely connecting scientists to expensive supercomputers (whose computing
		power was comparable to modern cell phones). Thus, they supported the abstraction
		of <i>conversation</i>. Currently, the Internet is mostly used for disseminating
		content to the masses, which mismatch definitely creates some problems.</p>
		
		<p>The <i>swift</i> protocol is a content-centric multiparty transport
		protocol. Basically, it answers one and only one question: <i>"Here is a 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">hash</a>!
		Give me data for it!"</i> A bit oversimplifying, it might be understood as
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a> 
		at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer">
		transport layer</a>. Ultimately, it aims at the abstraction of the Internet
		as a single big data <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">
		Cloud</a>. Such entities as storage, servers and connections are abstracted
		away and are virtually invisible at the API layer. The data is received
		from whatever source available and data integrity is checked 
		cryptographically with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_tree">
		Merkle hash trees</a>.</p>
		
		<p>An old Unix adage says: "free memory is wasted memory". Once a
		computer is powered on, there is no benefit in keeping some memory
		unoccupied. We may extend this principle a bit further:
		<ul>
			<li>free bandwidth is wasted bandwidth; 
			<li>free storage is wasted storage.
		</ul>
		Unless your power budget is really tight, there is no sense in conserving
		either. Thus, instead of putting emphasis on reciprocity and incentives
		we focus on ligther-footprint code, 
		<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/wg/ledbat/">non-intrusive</a> 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_avoidance_algorithm">
		congestion control</a> and automatic disk space management.
		</p>
		
		<p>Currently, most parts of the protocol/library are implemented, pass
		basic testing and successfully transfer data on real networks.
		After more scrutinized testing, the protocol and the library are expected
		to be real-life-ready in March'10.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id='design'>	<h2>Design of the protocol</h2>
	
		<p>Most features of the protocol are defined by its function of
		content-centric multiparty transport protocol. It entirely drops the TCP's
		abstraction of sequential reliable data stream delivery as it is redundant in
		our case. For example, out-of-order data could still be saved and the same
		piece of data might be always received from another peer.
		Being implemented over UDP, the protocol does its best to make
		every datagram self-contained.
		In general, cutting of unneeded functions and aggressive layer collapsing
		greatly simplified the protocol, compared to e.g. the BitTorrent+TCP stack.</p>
	
		<div class='fold'>	<h3>Atomic datagrams, not data stream</h3>
		<p>To achieve per-datagram flexibility of data flow and also to adapt to
		the unreliable medium (UDP, and, ultimately, IP), the protocol was built
		around the abstraction of atomic datagrams.
		Ideally, once received, a datagram is either
		immediately discarded or permanently accepted, ready to be forwarded to
		other peers. 
		For the sake of flexibility, most of the protocol's messages 
		are optional. It also has no "standard" header. Instead, each datagram
		is a concatenation of zero or more messages. No message ever spans two
		datagrams. Except for the data pieces themselves, no message is
		acknowledged, as thus, not guaranteed to be delivered.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class='fold'>	<h3>Scale-independent unit system</h3>
		<p>To avoid a multilayered request/acknowledgement system, when every
		next layer does basically the same, but for bigger chunks of data, as
		it is the case with BitTorrent+TCP packet-block-piece-file-torrent
		stacking, <i>swift</i> employs a scale-independent acknowledgement/
		request system, where data is measured by aligned power-of-2 intervals
		(so called bins). All acknowledgements and requests are done in terms
		of bins.</p>
		</div>
	
		<div class='fold'>	<h3>Datagram-level integrity checks</h3>
		<p><i>swift</i> builds Merkle hash trees down to every single packet
		(1 kilobyte of data). Once data is transmitted, all uncle hashes
		necessary for verification are prepended to the same datagram.
		As the receiver constantly remembers old hashes, the average number
		of "new" hashes, which have to be transmitted is small,
		normally around 1 per packet of data.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class='fold'>	<h3>NAT traversal by design</h3>	
		<p>The only method of peer discovery in <i>swift</i> is 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_exchange">PEX</a>:
		a third peer initiates a connection between two of its contacted peers.
		The protocol's handshake is engineered to perform simple NAT hole
		punching transparently, in case that is needed.
		</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class='fold'>	<h3>Push AND pull</h3>
		<p>The protocol allows both for PUSH (sender decides what to send) and
		PULL (receiver explicitly requests the data). PUSH is normally used as
		a fallback if PULL fails; also, the sender may ignore requests and send
		any data it finds convenient to send. Merkle hash trees allow this
		flexibility without causing security implications.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class='fold'>	<h3>No transmission metadata</h3>

	<div> <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
	
	<div class="fold"> <h3>Well, why "swift"?</h3>
		<p>That name served well to many other protocols; we hope it will serve well to ours.
		You may count it as a meta-joke. The original name for the protocol was "VicTorrent".
		We also insist on lowercase italic <i>"swift"</i> to keep the name formally  unique
		(for some definition of unique).</p>
	</div>
	
	<div> <h3>How is it different from... </h3>
	
		<div class='fold'><h4>...TCP?</h4>
		<p>TCP emulates reliable in-order delivery ("data pipe") over
		chaotic unreliable multi-hop networks. TCP has no idea what data it is dealing
		with, as the data is passed from the userspace. 
		In our case, the data is fixed in advance and many peers participate in
		distributing the same data. Orderness of delivery is of little importance and
		unreliability is naturally compensated by redundance.
		Thus, many functions of TCP turn out to be redundant.
		The only function of TCP that is also critical for <i>swift</i> is the congestion
		control, but... we need our own custom congestion control! Thus, we did not use
		TCP.</p>
		<p>That led both to hurdles and to some savings. As one example, every TCP
		connection needs to maintain buffers for the data that has left the sender's userspace, but
		did not yet arrive at the receiver's userspace. As we know that we are dealing
		with the same fixed data, we don't need to maintain per-connection buffers.
		</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class='fold'><h4>...UDP?</h4>
		<p>UDP, which is the thinniest wrapper around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4">
		IP</a>, is our choise of underlying protocol. From the standpoint of ideology, a
		transport protocol should be implemented over IP, but unfortunately that causes
		some chicken-and-egg problems, like a need to get into the kernel to get deployments,
		and a need to get deployments to be accepted into the kernel.
		UDP is also quite nice in regard to NAT penetration.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class='fold'><h4>...BitTorrent?</h4>
		<p>BitTorrent is an application-level protocol and quite a heavy one. We focused
		on fitting our protocol into the restrictions of the transport layer, assuming
		that the protocol might eventually be included into operating system kernels.
		For example, we stripped the protocol of any transmission's metadata (the
		.torrent file); leaving a file's root hash as the only parameter.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class='fold'><h4>...µTorrent's µTP?</h4>
		<p>Historically, BitTorrent gained lots of adaptations to its underlying
		transport. First and foremost, TCP is unable to prioritize traffic, so BitTorrent
		needed to coerce users somehow to tolerate inconviniences of seeding. That caused
		tit4tat and, to significant degree, rarest-first. Another example is the 4
		upload slots limitation. (Well, apparently, some architectural decisions in
		BitTorrent were dictated by oddities Windows 95, but... never mind.)
		Eventually, BitTorrent developers came to the conclusion that not annoying
		the user in the first place is probably a better stimulus. So they came up with
		the <a href='http://www.ietf.org/dyn/wg/charter/ledbat-charter.html'>LEDBAT</a>
		congestion control algorithm (Low Extra Delay Background Transport).
		LEDBAT allows a peer to seed without interfering with the regular traffic
		(in plain words, without slowing down the browser).
		To integrate the novel congestion control algorithm into BitTorrent incrementally,
		BitTorrent Inc had to develop TCP-alike transport named 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Transport_Protocol">µTP</a>.
		The <i>swift</i> project (then named VicTorrent) was started when we tried to understand
		what happens if we'll strip BitTorrent of any Win95-specific, TCP-specific
		or Python-specific workarounds. As it turns out, not much was left.
		</p>

		<div class='fold'><h4>...Van Jacobson's CCN?</h4>
		<p><a href="http://www.parc.com/about/people/88/van-jacobson.html">Van Jacobson's</a>
		team in PARC is doing exploratory research on 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-centric_networking">content-centric
		networking</a>. While BitTorrent works at layer 5 (application), we go to layer 4 (transport),
		PARC people are bold enough to go to layer 3 and to propose a complete replacement
		for the entire TCP/IP world. That is certainly a compelling vision, but we focus
		on near future (<10 years); while <a href="http://www.ccnx.org/">CCNx</a> is a
		much more ambitious rework.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class='fold'><h4>...DCCP?</h4>
		<p>This question arises quite frequently as DCCP is a congestion-controlled datagram 
		transport. The option of implementing <i>swift</i> over 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCCP">DCCP</a> was considered,
		but the inconvinience of working with an esoteric transport was not compensated by the
		added value of DCCP, which is limited to one mode of congestion control being readily
		implemented.
		Architectural restrictions imposed by DCCP were also found to be a major inconvenience.
		Last but not least, currently only Linux supports DCCP at the kernel level.</p>
